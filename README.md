Amazon Web Services - Python Apps - Lambda Functions Practice Codes

Lambda Functions are used to build a REST API to receive a list of reported Dragons (GET method) or report a new Dragon (POST method).
This repository contains scripts of three AWS Lambda Functions that I have created while passing the course 'Building Modern Python Applications on AWS':
<ul>
  <li>ListDragons - to return a list of all Dragons, or using GET request parameters by Dragon Name or by Dragon Family.</li>
  <li>ValidateDragon - to raise an Exception if Dragon with the Name reported exists.</li>
  <li>AddDragon - to report a new Dragon and add it to the list if it does not exist.</li>
 </ul>



This is not for use of another learners but instead to demonstrate my skills obtained on this course.
